# What A Mess!
### Excited to share our comprehensive solution for hostel mess management which we built in 36Hrs at the Digital Campus Hackathon held at Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI)!

Our solution includes two mobile apps (Hostel Student App and Hostel Admin App) and a website to make the entire process seamless and efficient.

The Hostel Student App provides students with an easy way to view their statistics and mess menu, while the Hostel Admin App allows the admin to mark daily entries by scanning a unique R code generated on the student app. The admin can also view all entries, add extra guests or food, and manage inventory. The website acts as the central hub for editing settings and monitoring performance.

Say goodbye to manual processes and hello to a smarter, more efficient system.
